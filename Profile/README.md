PillDent API built using `Exprees.js`,  you can see all the BackEnd API code & installation in this [BackEnd Repository](https://github.com/PillDent/PillDent-Backend)

**Teach Stack**:
  1. Express.js, used for developing APIs. With this popular framework, we can easily create high-performing APIs.
  2. Firestore, which serves as a solution for storing text data due to its high speed, scalability, and flexibility.
  3. Cloud Storage, selected as the storage service for image data.
  4. Cloud Run, chosen based on our need to quickly deploy APIs without directly managing the infrastructure.
  5. Firebase Auth, We chose Firebase Auth to set up authorization because of its easy integration with Express.js

PillDent App Using Machine Learning to predict images product. The model were build using `Convolutional Neural Network`.

You can see information about our machine learning code at this [Machine Learning Repostory](https://github.com/PillDent/PillDent-ML)

**Teach Stack**:
  1. Scikit-learn, for create system recommendation with algorithm cosine Similarity to provide recommendations for similar items.
  
  2. Convolutional Neural Networks, using VGG16 transfer learning for classification of 8 categori of item images
  
  3. TensorFlow.js, to save the model to Json and deploy it to express.js on the backend side

PillDent is an application built using `Kotlin programming language`, you can see all the mobile development code in this [Mobile Repository](https://github.com/PillDent/PillDent-MD)

**Teach Stack**:
  1. Android Jetpack, which makes the app development process easier, more efficient, and reduces boilerplate code.
  2. Retrofit, which is used to fulfill all API-related needs in the app.
